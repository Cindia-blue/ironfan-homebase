Overview

**@sya**: replace this section with a short overview of ironfan



## Getting started

Before you start, you may wish to fork the repo as you'll be making changes to personalize it for your platform.

Clone the repo. It will produce the directory we will call `homebase` from now on:

        git clone https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan-homebase homebase
        cd homebase
        git submodule update --init

Detailed instructions will now be in the file [`notes/INSTALL.md`]() **@sya please make this a link to wiki page**
